# Speaker identification using domain adaptation of speaking and singing voice

This project is an attempt to apply the paper: 
[Domain Adaptation for Speaker Recognition in Singing and Spoken Voice](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746111)

## Dataset

**Speaking Data:**
At the time of this writing, the dataset for [Voxceleb V2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html)  has been revoked from the official website. Due to lack of time, I have used previously (thankfully, since it is not available officially now) downloaded [VoxCeleb V1](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html) dataset. VoxCeleb V1 dataset is used for the speaking audio for the

**Singing Data**: The singing data that has been used is [JukeBox V1](https://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/dataset_detail.php?id=8&?title=JukeBox:_A_Speaker_Recognition_Dataset_with_Multi-lingual_Singing_Voice_Audio). The access to this data is not instant and required filling up a form. The version 2 of the dataset [JukeBox V2](https://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/dataset_detail.php?id=9) contains both speaking and singing audio files.


 Due to lack of time, as the owners give access in a couple of months, I have used JukeBox V1 (previously accessed) and VoxCeleb V1 for this project.
